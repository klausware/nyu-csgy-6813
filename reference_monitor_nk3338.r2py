This security layer inadequately handles A/B storage for files in RepyV2.



Note:
    This security layer uses encasementlib.r2py, restrictions.default, repy.py and Python
    Also you need to give it an application to run.
    python repy.py restrictions.default encasementlib.r2py [security_layer].r2py [attack_program].r2py 
    

Currently verifies that:
1. The A file starts with an S and ends with an E.
2. The A file starting and ending characters are strictly uppercase.
3. Whether the files already exist or not
4. If the A file already exists, that it only contains SE
5. If a new A file is created, then SE is written to it (under any circumstance)
6. Read ops only happening against the A file
7. Write ops only happening against the B file
8. TODO: If B file not valid, then read from A file
9. TODO: If B file is valid, then update A with new data
10.TODO: If one file exists but not the other (i.e. rm testfile.a but not testfile.b)

"""
Define a new function for checking the validity of the file.

Tracking the last character of the file was vexing because the readat function didn't seem to throw an outOfBounds EOF error until
it was 2 indexes beyond the last character in the file which meant having to subtract 3 from the variable i in order to grab the
last char. However, if the file was only comprised of say, 2 characters, then subtracting 3 would result in fetching the first
character of the file.

Therefore I needed to add a condition that checked the length of the file by looking at how large i was at the time of the exception.
If it was at least 5 characters long, then I could safely subtract 3 from the index counter, i, and get the last character. But if it was
anything less than 5 (i.e. 4) then the readat function seemingly stopped after reading the last character, plus 1 (as opposed to plus 2).
Which meant I only  needed to subtract 2 from the index.

EXAMPLE:
If it was a 15 character long string (0-14 index) then the index counter makes it 1o 17 before the exception is caught.
So I need to subtract 3 to get the last (15th) character, (14th index).

But if it's a 2 character long string (i.e. just SE, 0-1 index) then the counter makes it to 3 before the exception is caught.
So I need to subtract 2 to get to the 1th index (the last character, E)
